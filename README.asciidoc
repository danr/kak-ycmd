Kakoune YouCompleteMe Script
============================

This script provides YouCompleteMe support via ycmd in Kakoune.

Usage
-----

To use that script, two options must be set:

* +ycmd_path+: path of the ycmd python directory, on a cloned
               ycmd repo, that would be $REPO/ycmd

* +ycmd_port+: (defaulting to 12345) port to use for ycmd.

The cpp part of ycmd must be compiled manually, with clang
support.

Ycmd completion can be enabled with ycmd-enable-autocomplete
command.

To automate its activation, use a hook:

---
hook global WinSetOption filetype=cpp %{ ycmd-enable-autocomplete }
hook global WinSetOption filetype=(?!cpp).* %{ ycmd-diable-autocomplete }
---

Dependencies
------------

* +Jq+ for json parsing
* +OpenSSL+ for HMAC validation
* +base64+ for key encoding.
* +curl+ for http access
